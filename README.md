creme caramel is a very simple desert with very limited ingredients. it can easily be made at home and it is not that time consuming either.
creme caramel contains eggs and milk which is very good for the body. especially the egg yolkes contain a lot of good fats and other essential nutrients, while the egg ehite contains protein. milk is usually refered to as a complete diet food as it contains almost all kinds of nutrients essential for the human body.
but, it does contain a large percentage of sugar which is not good for the body on a daily basis.
but cooking this simple desert out once a week won't hurt:)
